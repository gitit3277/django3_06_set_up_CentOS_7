# This Shell script will automate the process of Installing the following: 
#	Python3 version 3.8.3
#	Sqlite3 version 3.32.1
# Compilation of Python3 and Sqlite3 is nessesary because django 3.06 requires Sqlite3 version 3.25.0 and above, which in turn requires Python version 3.8.0 and above. Normally this wouldnt be a problem and could be handled by installing latest binaries from yum, but they are not available for CentOS 7. 
#This script assumes the username is "user1", you may need to modify username with your own user name. Your username can be obtained by running command, whoami
